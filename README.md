# supported_clade_comparison
comparing highly supported clades found in multiple trees to see whether they have any strong conflicts

# Version history
I wrote this code to look at whether trees from different runs supported the same topology or not for the following manuscript:   
Alexander, A.M., Su, Y.C., Oliveros, C.H., Olson, K.V., Travers, S.L. and Brown, R.M., 2017. Genomic data reveals potential for hybridization, introgression, and incomplete lineage sorting to confound phylogenetic relationships in an adaptive radiation of narrow‚Äêmouth frogs. Evolution, 71(2), pp.475-488.


I think this dinky little R code is superceded by packages such as RWTY. Therefore, I am no longer actively maintaining this repository, but will respond to issues.
