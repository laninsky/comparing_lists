# renaming_things_inside_nexus_file

Things you need:

-- A tab-delimited txt document with the names you want in the left-hand column (namelist.txt), and the names you want replaced in the second

-- Your nexus files you want to have the names replaced on

-- For the nexus files, namelist.txt, and the script rename.R to be in the same directory. Once they are, you can cycle through multiple nexus files by copying and pasting the script in rename.sh
