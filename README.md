# supported_clade_comparison
comparing highly supported clades found in multiple trees to see whether they have any strong conflicts

# Version history
I wrote this code to look at whether trees from different runs supported the same topology or not. I think this dinky little R code is superceded by packages such as RWTY. Therefore, I am no longer actively maintaining this repository, but will respond to issues.
