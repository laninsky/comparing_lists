# formatting_genbank
Going from my crazy custom excel annotations into sequin format i.e. of absolutely no use to anyone but me :)

### Version history
This script was written to format the genbank entries associated with:  
Alexander, A.M., Su, Y.C., Oliveros, C.H., Olson, K.V., Travers, S.L. and Brown, R.M., 2017. Genomic data reveals potential for hybridization, introgression, and incomplete lineage sorting to confound phylogenetic relationships in an adaptive radiation of narrow‚Äêmouth frogs. Evolution, 71(2), pp.475-488.

Because it was a "one-off" script, I am no longer actively maintaining this repository, but will respond to issues.
